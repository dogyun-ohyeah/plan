<img width="300" height="400" src="./꿈_files/VFX학원,02.jpg" <p="">It is a job to edit video like the above picture. It takes a lot of Cg work for the movies and dramas we watch often. Like this, I want to edit the video and show it to many people. Also, if my edited video was in a movie or drama,  would be very proud. I want to be a good VFX designer and make a scene that many people can enjoy. That is my dream.<p></p>
